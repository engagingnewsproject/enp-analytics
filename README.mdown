### ENP Analytics
ENP Analytics is an online GUI for interacting with the data we've collected from users who have allowed us to track data from the Engaging News Project tools they're using.

Right now, the only data we're collecting and displaying is from the <a href="https://github.com/engagingnewsproject/engaging-buttons">Engaging Buttons WordPress plugin</a>.

### Local Set-up
We're using Gulp for compiling SASS. The gulpfile.js we're using is included in the repo.
